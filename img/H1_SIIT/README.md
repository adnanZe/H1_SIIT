Requirements

1. Implement the page design attached in the assignment,  using html and css. You can use what images you want, it is not mandatory to have the exact same pictures. Try to keep as much as possible the layout as well as the aspect ratio of the images.

2. Find a way to use the font that is present in the layout. Here you have the link of the font:

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish?query=muli&selection.family=Ovo&sidebar.open=true&preview.text=this%20is%20muli&preview.text_type=custom
